            <h2>What do you know about Palestine?</h2>
            <p>Palestine, area of the eastern Mediterranean region, comprising parts of modern Israel and the Palestinian territories
                of the Gaza Strip (along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea) and the West Bank (west of the Jordan River).</p>
            <p>The term Palestine has been associated variously and sometimes controversially with this small region, which some have asserted also includes Jordan. 
                Both the geographic area designated by the name and the political status of it have changed over the course of some three millennia. 
                The region (or at least a part of it) is also known as the Holy Land and is held sacred among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. 
                Since the 20th century it has been the object of conflicting claims of Jewish and Arab national movements, 
                and the conflict has led to prolonged violence and, in several instances, open warfare.</p>
            <p>The name Palestine has long been in popular use as a general term to denote a traditional region, but this usage does not imply precise boundaries. 
                The perception of what constitutes Palestine's eastern boundary has been especially fluid, although the boundary frequently has been perceived as lying east of the Jordan River, 
                extending at times to the edge of the Arabian Desert. 
                In contemporary understanding, however, Palestine is generally defined as a region bounded on the east by the Jordan River, 
                on the north by the border between modern Israel and Lebanon, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea (including the coast of Gaza), 
                and on the south by the Negev, with its southernmost extension reaching the Gulf of Aqaba. </p>
            <p>The strategic importance of the area is immense: through it pass the main roads from Egypt to Syria and from the Mediterranean to the hills beyond the Jordan River.
                Settlement depends closely on water, which is almost never abundant. Precipitation, which arrives in the cool half of the year, 
                decreases in amount in general from north to south and from the coast inland. 
                Perennial rivers are few, and the shortage of water is aggravated by the porous nature of the limestone rocks over much of the country.</p>
            <h2>Palestine's Early Roots</h2>
            <p> Scholars believe the name “Palestine” is derived from the name of the people—the Philistines—who occupied part of the region in the 12th century B.C.
                Over the centuries, Jews, Muslims and Christians and followers of other religions have all claimed special connections to the region.
                The Hebrew Bible contains narratives of ancient Israelites' presence in the land, including the kingdoms of Israel and Judah,
                established by King David and his descendants around 1000 B.C. Those kingdoms' rivals included other Canaanite groups like the Philistines, 
                whose territory encompassed the ancient city of Gaza.         
            <br>
            <br>
            The region was later conquered by numerous empires, including the Babylonians, Persians and Romans. 
            It first came under Muslim control when Jerusalem fell to the Rashidun Caliphate in 637, less than five years after the Prophet Muhammed's death. 
            During the Crusades, Christian armies from Western Europe fought both Muslims and local Christian factions for control of their religions' holy sites. 
            Between 1517 and 1917, the Ottoman Empire—whose official religion was Islam—ruled the region.
            </p>

            <h2>The Partition of Palestine</h2>
            <p>
                In 1947, after more than two decades of British rule, the United Nations proposed a plan to partition Palestine into two sections: an independent Jewish state and an independent Arab state. 
                The city of Jerusalem, which was claimed as a capital by both Jews and Palestinian Arabs, was to be an international territory with a special status.<br>
                <br>
                Most Jewish leaders accepted the plan, but many Palestinian Arabs—some of whom had been actively fighting British and Jewish interests in the region since the 1920s—vehemently opposed it.
                Some Arab leaders argued that they represented the majority of the population and should be granted more territory. They began to form volunteer armies throughout Palestine.
            </p>
            <h2>Israel Becomes a State</h2>
            <p>
                In May 1948, less than a year after the Partition Plan for Palestine was introduced, Britain withdrew from Palestine and Israel declared itself an independent state, 
                implying a willingness to implement the Partition Plan<br>
                Almost immediately, neighboring Arab armies moved in to prevent the establishment of the Israeli state. 
                The 1948 Arab-Israeli War that ensued involved Israel and five Arab nations—Transjordan (now Jordan), Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. 
                By the war's end in July 1949, Israel controlled more than two-thirds of the former British Mandate, 
                while Jordan took control of the West Bank and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip.<br>
                The 1948 conflict opened a new chapter in the struggle between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, 
                which now became a regional contest involving nation-states and a tangle of diplomatic, political and economic interests.
            </p>

            <h2>The PLO Is Born</h2>
            <p>
                In 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was formed for the purpose of establishing 
                a Palestinian Arab state on the land previously administered under the British Mandate, 
                and which the PLO considered to be occupied illegitimately by the State of Israel.n<br>

                <br>The PLO was originally dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel as a means of attaining its goal of Palestinian statehood. 
                By the time of the 1993 Oslo Accords, the PLO accepted Israel's right to exist in exchange 
                for formal recognition of the PLO by Israel—a high water mark in Israeli-Palestinian relations. 
                In 1969, the well-known Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat became the Chairman of the PLO and held that title until his death in 2004.
